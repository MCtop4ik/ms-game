On the Earth scientists from ROSCOSMOS.
Strange movements have been detected
on Mars, and you've been sent to find out
what's going on. You have successfully
reached there and see quite aggressive
aliens and also that the fuel warehouse
has been looted, fortunately, the aliens
do not know what to do with TATNEFT fuel.
Your task is to escape from Mars and tell
the world community about the existence
of aggressive life on Mars.
Good luck,
the future of humanity is in your hands
